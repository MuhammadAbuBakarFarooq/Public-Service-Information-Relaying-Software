# School-Inspection-System
(It's just and ideal project and these are just my thoughts not and official thing) Build a public service website for the local city on which there would be direct interaction between everyday people and the local Government Authority. System will be under a local Government Authority which would help in relaying important information about newly formed rules and regulations that are typically not easily related to the public. A Government person will be the admin of system who would handle all incoming and outgoing data.
