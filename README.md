# School-Inspection-System
Important Note
(It's just and ideal project and these are just my thoughts not and official thing) 

I buit a public service website for the local city on which there would be direct interaction between everyday people and the local Government Authority. System will be under a local Government Authority which would help in relaying important information about newly formed rules and regulations that are typically not easily related to the public. A Government person will be the admin of system who would handle all incoming and outgoing data.

Scope
All laws and regulations for public will be available for all registered and non-users.
Amin can add and update all laws and regulations.
Admin can add any alert and temporary law for public
Any civilian can be registered with their CNIC and by giving other essential information.
If a civilian notices any tension, accident or any other emergency at anywhere in the city, he/she can post on this application for public information.
 Admin will take action and will inform about issue, to related LEAâ€™s forces and rescue.
Only registered users can post, non-registered will not be able to post due to validity issue.
